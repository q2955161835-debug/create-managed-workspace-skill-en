name: create-managed-workspace
description: Create and validate managed workspaces for recurring project work. Use when Codex needs to create a multi-task workspace with AGENTS.md rules, docs project records, tasks/YYYYMMDD-slug task folders, per-task try folders, environment ledger files, or a specialized task-type workspace that also needs root skills storage. Also use when planning alignment of existing CAD, scraping, automation, research, or multi-output workspaces to this structure.

# Create Managed Workspace

## Overview

Use this skill to create a repeatable workspace for projects that produce files, span sessions, or contain many small tasks. Choose the workspace kind before creation:

- `multi-task`: default for general workspaces that hold unrelated or loosely related projects. Do not create root `skills/`.
- `specialized`: use for a dedicated task-type workspace such as CAD, scraping, automation, or research where the workspace should keep common skills or skill entrypoints. Create root `skills/`.

Do not choose CAD or scraping profiles; use one structure plus the task-type adjustment notes.

## First Actions

- Read the target repository or parent-folder rules before creating files.
- Run `git status --short --branch` in the target folder if it is already under Git.
- Before broad generation inside an existing Git-managed folder, create a checkpoint commit according to the local `AGENTS.md`.
- Use `scripts/new_workspace.py` for a new workspace root.
- Use `scripts/new_task.py` for a new small project under an existing managed workspace.
- Use `scripts/validate_workspace.py` after creation or before claiming the workspace is ready.

## Standard Multi-Task Workspace

Create this root structure by default:

```text
<workspace-root>/
|-- AGENTS.md
|-- .gitignore
|-- .env.example
|-- docs/
|   |-- project-map.md
|   |-- task-index.md
|   `-- progress.md
|-- tasks/
|   |-- README.md
|   `-- YYYYMMDD-short-task-name/
|       |-- README.md
|       |-- docs/
|       |   |-- project-map.md
|       |   `-- progress.md
|       |-- input/
|       |-- work/
|       |-- output/
|       `-- try/
|-- output/
`-- try/
```

For a specialized task-type workspace, add:

```text
<workspace-root>/
`-- skills/
    `-- .gitkeep
```

Rules:

- Do not create root `skills/` for a general multi-task workspace.
- Create root `skills/` only for a specialized task-type workspace. Keep it empty except `.gitkeep` at creation time, then store commonly used workspace-specific skills or documented entrypoints there.
- Keep root `try/` for workspace-level experiments only.
- Give every task directory its own `try/`; clearing a task `try/` must not affect formal results.
- Put task context in `tasks/YYYYMMDD-slug/README.md`.
- Put task long-lived structure and directory responsibilities in `tasks/YYYYMMDD-slug/docs/project-map.md`.
- Put task progress in `tasks/YYYYMMDD-slug/docs/progress.md`.
- Put task final deliverables in `tasks/YYYYMMDD-slug/output/`.

## Scripts

Create a workspace:

```powershell
python D:\path\create-managed-workspace\scripts\new_workspace.py "D:\path\workspace" --name "Workspace Name"
```

Create a specialized task-type workspace with root `skills/`:

```powershell
python D:\path\create-managed-workspace\scripts\new_workspace.py "D:\path\cad-workspace" --name "CAD Workspace" --workspace-kind specialized
```

PowerShell wrapper:

```powershell
D:\path\create-managed-workspace\scripts\New-Workspace.ps1 -Path "D:\path\workspace" -Name "Workspace Name"
```

Specialized wrapper:

```powershell
D:\path\create-managed-workspace\scripts\New-Workspace.ps1 -Path "D:\path\cad-workspace" -Name "CAD Workspace" -WorkspaceKind specialized
```

Create a task:

```powershell
python D:\path\create-managed-workspace\scripts\new_task.py "D:\path\workspace" "Short Task Name"
```

Validate:

```powershell
python D:\path\create-managed-workspace\scripts\validate_workspace.py "D:\path\workspace"
```

Validate specialized mode explicitly:

```powershell
python D:\path\create-managed-workspace\scripts\validate_workspace.py "D:\path\cad-workspace" --workspace-kind specialized
```

## References

- Read `references/task-type-adjustments.md` when the user wants to adapt the standard structure for CAD, scraping, research, automation, or other task families.
- Read `references/existing-workspace-alignment.md` before planning to organize an existing workspace. This reference is guidance only; it does not authorize automatic migration.
- Read `references/rule-checklist.md` before editing generated workspace rules or checking whether a workspace is complete.
